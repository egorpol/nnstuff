Resources I use for teaching topics related to machine learning and neural networks.

- `neuron.ipynb`: A quick introduction to neurons, weights, biases, and dot products.
- `dufour_peaks_regression2.ipynb`: An introduction to linear and polynomial regression based on micro timing analysis of peak data from "Bocalises Pr√©lude" by Denis Dufour.
- `gradient2d.ipynb`, `gradient3d.ipynb`: Interactive visualizations for gradient descent in 2D and 3D.
